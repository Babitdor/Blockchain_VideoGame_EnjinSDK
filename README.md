# Blockchain Memory Game 

An innovative decentralized game that utilizes blockchain technology to enable in-game asset ownership, rewards, and player interactions. The game is built using Solidity, which allows for the creation of secure and transparent smart contracts that manage in-game assets, player transactions, and rewards directly on the blockchain.

This project demonstrates how blockchain can be integrated into the gaming world, allowing players to have full control and ownership of their virtual assets through tokens and smart contracts.

# Features 
1. Decentralized Asset Ownership: Players can own in-game assets (such as items, characters, or skins) as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
2. Smart Contracts: The game runs on smart contracts written in Solidity to handle in-game transactions, rewards, and asset management.
3. Player-to-Player Trading: Players can trade, buy, and sell their in-game assets with others, directly through the blockchain.
4. Transparent and Secure: Blockchain ensures that all transactions are transparent, traceable, and secure, preventing fraud and giving players control over their digital assets.
5. In-Game Rewards: Players receive blockchain-based rewards, which can be redeemed for tokens or NFTs.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Node.js (v16 or higher)
2. npm or yarn
3. Truffle (for deploying and testing smart contracts)
4. Ganache (for running a local Ethereum blockchain)
5. MetaMask (for interacting with the Ethereum network through your browser)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install all the necessary packages.

## `Open Ganache`
Create a Blockchain server,
Take one of the accounts in Ganache and import it to your Metamask Wallet by pasting the secret key. (Localhost 8575 network)

## `truffle compile`
To compile the Solidity Contracts.

## `truffle migrate --reset`
To migrate the contracts to Ganache Blockchain Server.

## After this you are done!

### Just run `npm start` and Login with Metamask on Popup.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
