# Memory Game 

A simple Memory Game, to demonstrate the implementation of Blockchain, using Solidity, Web3JS and NodeJS. Ganache for the personal Blockchain to test and deploy the contracts

# Working 

It's a simple memory Game, if you are successful in obtaining the cards in the game.
That Card will be sent to you, in your wallet upon confirming the transaction, and that card will be store in your wallet as an NFT, to either be sold or traded.

For Implementation sake, i used Ganache to simulate, the working of the Game.
